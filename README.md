# WhoIsIt
This one gonna meet my friends and say them nasty things

I plan to run it on my RaspberriPi with camera and screen attached. The plan is to stick it right in front of the door and if this piece of software recognizes the person it prints some nasty things on the screen. For example, "Hi, Donalp Trump. That's a nice wall you've got there". I belive that with this thing everyone should feel welcome and wanted in my home.
